Title: Implements Clustering and Halo analysis orientated algorithms within
    SciDB
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: "William Comaskey <williamcomaskey@gmail.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: This Package implements various functions and algorithms used for
    the analysis of Clustering and Large-Scale structure within cosmology. This
    package aims to allow users to have an interface capable of storing and
    analyzing their Observational and Simulated Cosmological data-sets. SciDB
    is capable of performing parallel computations on arrays within its
    database and allows for parallel loading of massive amounts of data.
    Supported by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab: Computational Cosmology Center
    and The Department of Energy
